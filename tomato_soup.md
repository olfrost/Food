# Homemade tomato soup



## Pre-requisites

A food processor to blend the soft stuff into soup.

## Ingredients

Serves 1-2:

- 200g vine tomatoes
- 150-175g cherry tomatoes
- 1/2 large red onion
- Chilli-infused oil (or olive oil with 1/2 teaspoon of hot curry powder)
- 1/2 teaspoons of ground coriander
- 1 clove of garlic
- (Optional) - Nice sourbread

## Method

1. Preheat t'oven to 200C.
2. Place foil in the bottom of a large tray to catch the juices.
3. Peel and finely chop the onion, slice the vine tomatoes in half and place in the bottom of the tray with the rest of the cherry tomatoes.
4. Finely dice the onion and garlic and chuck it in.
5. Add the ground coriander (and/or curry powder) and add a fairly generous amount of oil. Toss everything together.
6. Stick it in the oven for 20 minutes or so - try not to burn it or it will taste crap.
7. Add to a food processor and blend it with a bit of water.
